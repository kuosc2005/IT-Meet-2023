      content="IT Meet is a non-profit, student-organized
    university-level tech meetup held annually at Kathmandu University,
    Dhulikhel. It is the collaborative effort of the Kathmandu University
    Computer Club (KUCC) and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
    (DoCSE). With a strong focus on celebrating recent achievements in the field
    of information and technology, IT MEET has successfully established
    itself as a platform that offers opportunities for tech enthusiasts to share
    innovative ideas, compete with their peers, and gain first hand experience
    of the real world. Now, with the theme “Tech Unleashed, Ideas Ignited”, we
    are all set to embark on the journey of “IT MEET 2023”. Our vision is to
    provide future change-makers with a platform to delve deep into the insights
    of the tech world, emerging not only with technical skills and knowledge
    about hardware and computers but also with personal growth."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
